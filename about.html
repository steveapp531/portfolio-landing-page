                If I'm not in the lab then I'm behind my PC putting elements together for ecstasy or syntactically
                constructing algorithmic architectures to facilitate seamless digital interactions. As a dynamic
                creative professional, I transition between graphic design and web development. I'm immersed in crafting
                captivating visual experiences and coding appealing web interfaces when not exploring innovative ideas.

                Proficient in industry-leading Adobe Creative Suite tools, including Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator,
                and Premiere Pro, I also leverage Canva for streamlined graphic design. Additionally, I've honed my
                skills in After Effects. Complementing my creative expertise, I hold certifications in:

                Digital Marketing (Google Certified)

                Fundamentals of Web Development (IBM Certified)

                I have a passion for science and research with a research interest in the intersection of Microbial
                pathogenesis, Biological Chemistry, and Bioinformatics. with a focus on understanding the molecular
                mechanisms underlying microbial interactions, developing novel biotechnological tools for disease
                diagnosis and prevention, and leveraging bioinformatic approaches to analyze and interpret large-scale
                biological data. I have had a lot of laboratory training, and research experiences as a Laboratory
                Technologist and Quality Control Analyst
